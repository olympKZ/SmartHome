# SmartHome
SmartHome - is a project consisting of a physical device and an app. SmartHomeâ€™s task is to allow the user to use the physical device as a security and monitoring system while being able to control it in the app. The app shows information about/from 3 sensors: motion, sound, temperature & humidity. The main feature is that turning security mode ON (in the app) causes a buzzer/alarm to go off and notification to get issued if either motion or sound sensors have been triggered.
